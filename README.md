# multiple-timers-app

Your task is to build a web application that allows users to set multiple timers. The application's design should match the UI provided in the Figma file.
The Figma design is broken down into three main components:

Timer Input Section
Active Timers Display Section
Timer End Display Design
1. Timer Input Section
This section allows the user to input the desired time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Upon setting the time and clicking the 'Start New Timer' button, a new timer should be started and added to the Active Timers Display Section.

2. Active Timers Display Section
This section should dynamically display all active timers. Each timer should show the time remaining and have a 'Stop Timer' button to cancel the timer. Make sure that each timer shows the countdown from whatever time was set to 0, and they need to update every second.

3. Timer End Display Design
Upon reaching zero, the display for that timer should change to match the design provided in the Figma file. Additionally, an audio alert of your choice should be played to notify the user that the timer has ended.
